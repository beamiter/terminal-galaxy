Learning what's going on behind the scenes in X11 terminal emulators.

This is for educational purposes.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libx11

To build the program, run:

    $ make

You really should read the source code.


Running
-------

Open a new terminal window:

    $ eduterm

If you use a tiling window manager, make sure that you're in "floating"
mode.
