xiate is a terminal emulator.

It tries to keep a balance between "features" and "simplicity". This is
achieved by using VTE as a powerful backend, while UI, configuration,
and code try to remain much more minimalistic.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries (or newer versions) are required:

    - GTK+ 3.24
    - GLib 2.68
    - VTE 0.64

Older versions might work, too, but they are not tested.

xiate was written on GNU (Arch Linux). No portability tests are run by
the author, but the code tries to stick to POSIX and will probably work
on other systems as well.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

It's as simple as:

    $ xiate

This launches one terminal window. There are no tabs.

You can also run a program directly:

    $ xiate -e vim

There are some more command line arguments. Please refer to the manpage.

xiate reads "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xiate/config.ini" on startup. Please
consult "config.example.ini" to find out which options you can set.
