Release history for xiate

v22.12  2022-12-23
  [Added]
  - We set the Wayland "app_id" now by combining "res_name" and
    "res_class" of "WM_CLASS" into "{res_name}.{res_class}".

v21.05  2021-05-29
  [Changed]
  - "config.h" is gone. Instead, you can now place a "config.ini" in the
    directory "~/.config/xiate".

  [Added]
  - Hotkeys are now customizable via config.ini.

v20.07  2020-07-19
  [Fixed]
  - Build no longer depends on GNU sed.

v20.06  2020-06-09
  [Fixed]
  - Outdated hotkey was listed in config.def.h.

  [Added]
  - "Ctrl + Shift + P" selects previous font. (Opposite of the already
    existing "Ctrl + Shift + N".)

v20.05  2020-05-15
  [Changed]
  - Hotkeys for changing fonts have been revised. They no longer depend
    on you having a keypad. This also changes how fonts are addressed
    with "--fontindex": Indexes now start at 0. You can now specify an
    arbitrary number of fonts (but at least one).
  - The hotkey for launching the history handler has been changed from
    "Ctrl + Shift + F" to "Ctrl + Shift + H" to be more mnemonic.

  [Fixed]
  - When resetting the font scale, the window will be resized
    accordingly to keep the same number of columns and lines.
  - Makefile: Copy config.h from config.def.h if it does not exist.

v20.04  2020-04-22
  [Changed]
  - config.h: "c_bold" now defaults to NULL which harmonizes better with
    "bold_is_bright = FALSE".
  - config.h: Default to a generic "Monospace" instead of "qsqs".

v20.03  2020-03-28
  [Changed]
  - config.h: "enable_bold" has been removed. VTE's function
    "vte_terminal_set_allow_bold()" is deprecated now and will probably
    be removed soon: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=762247#c36
  - config.h: We default to "bold_is_bright = FALSE" now, but you can
    still return to the old behaviour as long as this switch remains
    available in VTE (but you should expect it to vanish in a few
    years).

v19.11  2019-11-02
  [Added]
  - Command line option to choose initial font.

v19.05  2019-05-30
  [Added]
  - config.h: Add option "bold_is_bright". VTE's default has changed and
    I want the old behaviour back.

v18.07  2018-07-08
  [Changed]
  - Allow customization of cursor attributes: Blinking on/off and shape.
    This is listed under "Changed", because you have to merge the new
    config.def.h in order to define two new variables.
  - The sub directory "man1" has been removed, the manpage now lives in
    the repo's root directory. This is only relevant to you if you don't
    use "make install".
  - The project has moved away from GitHub, thus changing some links in
    the documentation.

v18.05  2018-05-20
  [Changed]
  - The client-server model has been removed. There's only one binary
    called "xiate" now and it launches one terminal window. This change
    has been done to be more resilient towards crashes (errors in xiate
    itself or the libraries it uses).
  - The Makefile now explicitly demands C99.

v18.04  2018-04-30
  [Added]
  - When the mouse pointer hovers over an explicit hyperlink, xiate now
    shows a tooltip window that displays the link's target.

  [Changed]
  - Geometry hints will no longer be set on our top-level windows. This
    functionality has been removed from GTK+.

v18.03  2018-03-17
  [Changed]
  - It is no longer possible to set handler paths in config.h to NULL.
  - Handlers ("link_handler" and "history_handler") will now be searched
    for in your $PATH.
  - "hyperlink_handler" has been replaced by "link_handler". It will be
    called for explicit hyperlinks as before, but also for plain text
    links that have been detected by your regex.
  - The hardcoded default of copying links to the X11 clipboard is gone.
    If you want this functionality, you can use a tool like xclip in
    your link handler.

v18.01  2018-01-28
  [Fixed]
  - There was a race condition in the communication between server and
    client. Depending on your machine (or its current load), the server
    might not have read all data sent by the client. Example: When
    running "xiatec -hold -e ls -al", the server might have dropped the
    "-e ..." part, thus running only a shell.

  [Changed]
  - xiatec now keeps running until the associated terminal window has
    been closed.
  - This requires a change in the protocol spoken between server and
    client. "H" now needs a NUL byte following it and the entire
    sequence must be enclosed in "S\000 .. F\000".
  - xiatec will now exit with 0 if the child program terminated
    successfully and with 1 otherwise. This requires another change in
    the protocol: The server will send exactly one byte to the client,
    containing said exit code.
  - Also, the client has been reimplemented in C, so the dependency on
    Bash and socat is gone.
  - Sockets now live in /tmp/xiate-$uid.

  [Added]
  - xiate (the daemon) now aborts if there is an unexpected number of
    command line arguments. This prevents accidents like running "xiate
    --suffix test" which would result in the server listening on the
    "main" socket.
  - Ctrl+F dumps the terminal history to a file and calls a tool you
    specify in config.h. This allows you to search through history or
    save parts of it.

v17.10  2017-10-18
  [Changed]
  - We use vte_terminal_spawn_async() now, because the _sync() function
    has been deprecated. This means that you now get a proper error
    message on STDERR if spawning the main child process failed.

  [Added]
  - Support explicit hyperlinks. This adds the new variable
    "hyperlink_handler" to config.h and REQUIRES you to use VTE 0.50 or
    newer. See config.def.h for more info on that feature.

v17.09  2017-09-16
  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

v17.02  2017-02-12
  [Fixed]
  - xiatec no longer fails if user parameters contain printf format
    strings (ouch).

  [Added]
  - xiate now hides the cursor and changes the window title when the
    child process exits and "-hold" is used.
  - xiate should cope better with OOM situations. We always try to keep
    the process running in order to *not* kill all your open terminal
    windows.

v16.12  2016-12-24
  [Changed]
  - The deprecated GRegex API is no longer being used by xiate.
  - xiate now expects at least VTE version 0.46.

  [Added]
  - Update geometry hints when changing font or font size.
  - xiate now responds to resize requests of terminal applications.
  - Terminal size (in terms of rows and columns) is being retained on
    changes to fonts or font size.

v16.10  2016-10-29
  [Added]
  - Multiple fonts can be specified and you can switch during runtime.

v16.08  2016-08-20
  [Added]
  - Foreground color of text under the cursor can be customized.

v16.06  2016-06-26
  [Changed]
  - Don't try to reduce flickering by setting the GtkWindow's background
    color anymore. This issue appears to have resolved itself (other VTE
    terminals are fine, too).
  - "internal_border" has been removed from config.h. If you really want
    to use an internal border, put this in your ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:

        vte-terminal {
            padding: 30px;
        }

v16.05  2016-05-03
  - Update for slightly new VTE API.

v16.01  2016-01-05
  [Fixed]
  - Properly set X11 window title on the child application's request.
    Changing icon names is no longer officially supported, though.
  - Improve window size of newly created floating windows: Set geometry
    hints and use the correct font.

  [Changed]
  - Makefile also installs the default client.
  - Use CSS to set the "internal border". This results in the actual
    border being one pixel smaller than before.
  - "args_default" has been replaced by the boolean option "login_shell".
    We now autodetect your shell.
  - xiate now expects at least VTE version 0.42.

v15.10  2015-10-04
  - This is the initial release of xiate.
  - Daemon, client, manpages.
